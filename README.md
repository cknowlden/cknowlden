### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Rural Wisconsin Mental Health Awareness website.  I am partnering with the local hospital's psychiatry residency program to address growing suicide rates within the Wisconsin farming community. The website provides statistics and information about suicide prevention, mental health resources, a local farmer appreciation event
with guest speakers to highlight the importance of mental health awareness, and the ability for farmers and their loved ones to create socializing events to bring their community together.

- I recently graduated with a certificate in full stack software engineering.  Primarily we used the PERN stack.  I enjoy javascript but am also in the process of learning python as well.

- 💬 Fun fact:  I am an amatuer astronomer interested in learning more about theoretical physics and string theory.
